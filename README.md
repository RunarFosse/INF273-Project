## How to build

All builds require [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to be installed, and accessed using ```cmake``` in the terminal.

### MacOS or Linux
Run ```build.sh``` from root directory.

### Windows
Run ```build.bat``` from root directory.

For Windows, ```-O2``` optimization level should be compiled with instead of ```-O3```. Simply modify ```CMakeLists.txt``` respectively.
